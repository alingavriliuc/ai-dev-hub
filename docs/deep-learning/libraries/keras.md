To get started with Keras, visit the official [Keras Documentation](https://keras.io/getting_started/). The documentation provides extensive guidance on setting up, using, and optimizing Keras for your deep learning tasks.

## What is Keras?

Keras is a high-level, open-source deep learning API originally developed by Google and now part of the TensorFlow project. It is designed to streamline the creation and training of neural networks, making deep learning accessible to both beginners and experts.

Key features of Keras include:

- **Ease of Use**: Keras simplifies the implementation of neural networks with its user-friendly, Python-based interface. It enables rapid prototyping and experimentation.

- **Flexibility**: Keras offers compatibility with multiple backend neural network computation engines, including TensorFlow, Theano, and Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK). This flexibility allows you to choose the backend that best suits your project's requirements.

- **Community Support**: Being a widely adopted deep learning framework, Keras enjoys a vibrant community of users and developers. This means you can benefit from a wealth of resources, tutorials, and pre-trained models.

Keras is an excellent choice for tasks such as image recognition, natural language processing, and more. With its intuitive design and extensive capabilities, it's a valuable tool for building and training neural networks.

## Installation

You can easily install Keras using the following pip command:

```bash
pip install keras
```

Whether you're an aspiring deep learning enthusiast or a seasoned practitioner, Keras provides a powerful and accessible framework to bring your neural network projects to life. Dive into the world of deep learning with Keras!
